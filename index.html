				<h2 id="whats_plex">What's Plex?</h2>
				<h3>So what is Plex anyway?</h3>
				<p class="h3">You can think of Plex as a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video that is operated by someone you know instead of a huge company. What this means is that they have complete control over what content is available, and can often obtain shows and movies that you're looking for.</p>
				<h3>Is Plex free?</h3>
				<p class="h3">Server owners typically provide access to close friends and family only and don't charge for it.
				<p class="h3">Many server operators do pay a monthly or yearly fee for some additional features known as <em>Plex Pass</em> from the company that makes the Plex software. This helps to support ongoing efforts to make the Plex software better.</p>
				<p class="h3">Additionally, Plex servers are a significant investment for the owner. The server hardware and storage devices are expensive to obtain and operate.</p>
				<p class="h3">As a viewer, you can connect to and watch content on Plex servers for free through the Plex.tv web site. However viewing on the website often requires that the server transcode the media for you (more on that later). By using a Plex player that's specific to your hardware and platform, you'll get a better playback experience. On some platforms like iPhone and iPad as well as Android phones and tablets, you will have to pay a small one-time fee (around $7 CAD) to activate the Plex player on your iTunes or Google Play account. This will unlock the player on all the devices you use on your account.</p>
				<h2 id="getting_started">Getting Started</h2>
				<p>If you're here, you were probably invited to join my Plex server. The first step is to visit <a href="https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/" target="_blank">Plex.tv</a> and create a free account.</p>
				<p>Once your account is created, you need to send me the username or email address you used to sign up. Shortly after you'll receive an email inviting you to join my server. Click the link in the email to accept the invitation.</p>
				<p>After that, you can return to <a href="https://www.plex.tv/sign-in/" target="_blank">Plex.tv</a> and log in with the account you created. Once signed in, you will see the <strong>Sign Up</strong> button in the upper right has changed to <strong>Launch</strong>. Click that to begin enjoying content on my Plex server.</p>
				<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
				<p>Plex servers are organized with Libraries in order to accomplish a number of things. Foremost this helps viewers locate the content they're looking for. Broad categories like <em>TV Shows</em> and <em>Movies</em> also enable the Plex server to obtain the correct information to fill in the details about content such as the synopsis, actors and other information about the media.</p>
				<p>Libraries are often further separated into subjects like <em>Reality TV</em>, <em>Kid's TV</em> or <em>Documentaries</em> to facilitate finding what you want to watch.
				<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
				<p>Depending on what device or platform you're using Plex from, the interface can vary slightly, but typically you will find a list of the Libraries on the server located in a table on the left side of the display. Clicking or tapping the name of a Library will change the content view on the bulk of the page to that Library. Along the top of the main view you can switch between Recommended, Library or Playlist.</p>
				<h3>Recommended</h3>
				<p class="h3">This is a view of content the server selects that contains a mix of items in this library that are new or popular.</p>
				<h3>Library</h3>
				<p class="h3">This view shows the full contents of the Library. In alphabetical order by default. But you can use filters and sorting to change how the list is presented.</p>
				<h3>Playlists</h3>
				<p class="h3">If the server owner has curated playlists of content - such as all the films in a series - they may be presented here. It is normal if this page is empty.</p>
				<h2 id="advanced">Advanced</h2>
				<p>Plex makes use of a technology called <em>transcoding</em> to dynamically decode and re-encode media in real time in order to accommodate a wide variety of play back hardware, software and internet speeds. In the settings for your player, you can make adjustments to what your Plex client requests from the server for playback quality. If your device and internet connection are capable, you can change the setting for <em>Remote Playback Quality</em> to <em>Original</em>. This will ensure you get the best possible viewing experience and also puts less strain on my server as it doesn't have to work as hard to deliver your content.</p>
